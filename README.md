# Top Voted Baby Names

## Project 6
A web app where people can vote for their favorite baby names and then see the top 10 voted baby names for boys and girls. The web app was created using SQL, PHP, AJAX, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap.

### Functionality
Scroll down to the bottom of the web app, enter a favorite baby name, select the gender from the drop-down menu, and then click on the vote button. The vote will be recorded and the web app will output the results with the top 10 voted baby names for boys and girls.
